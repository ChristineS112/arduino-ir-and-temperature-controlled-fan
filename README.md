# arduino-ir-and-temperature-controlled-fan

This project controls a fan blade attached to a DC motor using an IR remote and a temperature sensor. If the temperature rises above 25°C, the motor turns on automatically. The fan can also be triggered manually using the remote. System information, including temperature readings and fan status, is displayed on a 16x2 LCD.
